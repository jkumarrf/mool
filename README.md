mool: The mool build tool.
==========================

#### What is it?

* It is a collection of scripts that help building code written in C++, Python,
Scala or Java.
* It is very similar to the following tools:

1. [Twitter pants](http://pantsbuild.github.io/)
2. [Facebook buck](http://facebook.github.io/buck/)

The current implementation has been extended from another implementation of
[mooltool](https://github.com/anirban001/mooltool).

#### Installation
Just checkout the latest version from repository and run [install script](https://github.com/jkumarrf/mool/blob/master/installer/install_mooltool.py). This would create a temporary setup in repository root directory and you will be able to use the [example code](https://github.com/jkumarrf/mool/tree/master/code_root).

Check [install script](https://github.com/jkumarrf/mool/blob/master/installer/install_mooltool.py) help for creating a persistant setup in a different location.
